# SlowMotionVideoApp

An advanced iOS application for high-frame-rate video recording with intelligent interaction and enhanced sharing capabilities.

## Project Description

SlowMotionVideoApp is designed to record high-quality 120FPS videos that can be activated by a voice command ("ready"). The app allows users to configure recording duration (default 10 seconds) and automatically loops recorded videos with customizable playback speeds (ranging from 0.25x to 2.0x in 0.25 increments, default: 0.5x) until receiving another record instruction. Users can easily switch between front and back cameras for versatile recording options. It includes a voice command pronunciation trainer to improve recognition accuracy and comprehensive cloud storage/sharing options for saved videos.

## Key Features

- **High-frame-rate recording** (120FPS) for smooth slow-motion playback
- **Voice-activated recording** using the "ready" command
- **Configurable recording duration** (5-30 seconds)
- **Flexible playback speeds**: From 0.25x to 2.0x in 0.25 increments
- **Front and back camera switching** with thread-safe operations
- **Visual feedback** for camera operations and playback speeds
- **Camera-specific contextual messages** during recording
- **Voice command training** to improve recognition accuracy
- **Cloud storage integration** with multiple providers
- **Comprehensive sharing options** with privacy controls

## Getting Started

### Using the CLI Simulator

The CLI simulator allows you to test the core functionality of the app without needing an iOS device:

1. Run the simulator:
   ```
   swift SlowMotionSimulator/main.swift
   ```

2. Available commands:
   - `ready`: Start recording
   - `settings`: Change recording duration
   - `speed`: Change playback speed
   - `faster` or `+`: Increase playback speed during playback
   - `slower` or `-`: Decrease playback speed during playback
   - `voice`: Toggle voice control
   - `train`: Practice voice commands
   - `cloud`: Upload/share videos
   - `switch`: Toggle between front and back cameras
   - `exit`: Quit the simulator

### Real App Deployment

To build and deploy the full iOS app:

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Set up provisioning profiles and signing
3. Build and run on an iOS device

## Technologies Used

- **Swift** programming language
- **iOS** development framework
- **Core Video** and **AVFoundation** for video processing
- **Speech Recognition** APIs for voice commands
- **Cloud Storage** APIs for sharing functionality

## Future Enhancements

- Video filters and effects
- Background music options
- Enhanced social sharing integration 
- Analytics for video performance
- External camera support

## Recent Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the app's stability, performance, and user experience:

### Critical Fixes
- **Fixed runtime exceptions** related to AVCaptureSession configuration
- **Enhanced thread safety** for all camera operations and UI updates
- **Improved camera switching** with better error handling and synchronization
- **Optimized execution sequences** to prevent race conditions

### UI Enhancements
- **Added clear status indicators** with "RECORDING" and "REPLAYING" prompts
- **Implemented progress bars** for both recording and playback
- **Added real-time percentage indicators** during recording and playback
- **Enhanced visual feedback** during camera initialization and switching

### Functionality Improvements
- **Fixed settings persistence** for recording duration and playback speed
- **Improved "ready" command** responsiveness and recognition
- **Added confirmation messages** when settings are updated
- **Enhanced playback speed selection** with clearer visual indicators
