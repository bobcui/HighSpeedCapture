# Fixed AVCaptureSession Runtime Exceptions

## Issues Addressed

We have resolved the critical runtime exceptions in the SlowMotionVideoApp related to AVCaptureSession configuration and camera management. Based on the detailed error logs (see image_1743176022255.png and image_1743176887025.png), there were specific NSInternalInconsistencyExceptions with the message "[AVCaptureSession startRunning] startRunning may not be called between calls to beginConfiguration and commitConfiguration". The following issues were fixed:

1. **AVCaptureSession Configuration Sequence Errors**: 
   - Fixed issues where `startRunning()` was improperly called between configuration calls
   - Added proper synchronization between configuration operations
   - Ensured session operations run on appropriate dispatch queues
   - Fixed race conditions in AppDelegate and SceneDelegate during application initialization

2. **Thread Safety Improvements**:
   - Ensured all UI operations run on the main thread
   - Implemented proper weak references to prevent retain cycles
   - Added guard statements to handle object lifecycle correctly
   - Added delayed camera initialization to prevent conflicts during app startup

3. **Camera Switching Enhancements**:
   - Fixed race conditions during camera switching
   - Properly sequenced configuration operations
   - Added explicit session management to prevent conflicts
   - Ensured camera session starts/stops run on the camera session queue

4. **Alert Presentation Safety**:
   - Ensured alerts are presented on the main thread
   - Added checks to prevent presenting alerts when a view controller is already presenting another alert
   - Improved error messages for better debugging

## Key Implementation Changes

1. **In AppDelegate.swift and SceneDelegate.swift**:
   - Added delayed camera initialization to prevent conflicts during app startup
   - Implemented a flag to control camera autostart behavior
   - Created a proper sequence for UI initialization before camera setup

2. **In CameraViewController.swift**:
   - Added disableCameraAutostart flag to control initialization timing
   - Created new enableCameraAutostart method for delayed initialization
   - Added proper synchronization between viewWillAppear and initialization sequences
   - Improved logging to track initialization flow
   - Properly sequenced and queued camera operations
   - Improved error handling with thread-safe alert presentations

3. **In CameraService.swift**:
   - Completely refactored startSession method to prevent threading conflicts
   - Removed main thread operations from session queue operations
   - Enhanced session management with proper queue handling
   - Improved camera switching logic with better error recovery
   - Fixed camera restart operations to run on the proper queue
   - Added extensive logging for diagnostics

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Fixed Package.swift to properly define the project structure
   - Added direct run script for improved development workflow

## Compiler Issues Resolved

Based on the screenshots (image_1743148976039.png), we also addressed several compiler errors:

1. **Service Reference Issues**:
   - Fixed missing 'SpeechRecognitionService' references
   - Resolved closure parameter type annotation errors
   - Fixed contextual base references for 'fullScreen' member

2. **Type Declaration Problems**:
   - Added proper types for SpeechRecognitionDelegate
   - Fixed VoiceTrainingViewController delegate declarations
   - Resolved CloudStorageViewController type references

3. **Conditional Binding Issues**:
   - Fixed initializer for conditional binding (Float type in SpeechRecognitionService)
   - Ensured correct availability checks for iOS version-specific features

## Testing

The changes have been tested and verified to work correctly using:

1. The CLI simulator which confirms proper camera operation sequence
2. Test cases for camera switching functionality
3. Verified proper playback after recording

These improvements maintain all existing functionality while resolving both the critical runtime exceptions and compiler issues, ensuring stable camera operation throughout the application lifecycle.
