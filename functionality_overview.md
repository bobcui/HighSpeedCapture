## Implementation Notes

The app simulates these features in a command-line environment but is designed for iOS implementation using:
- Swift programming language
- iOS development framework
- Core Video and AVFoundation for video processing
- Speech recognition APIs for voice commands
- Cloud storage APIs for sharing functionality
